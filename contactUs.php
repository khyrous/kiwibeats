				Learning to play the drums takes practice, patience & an interest for rhythm.<br>
				Iâ€™ve been drumming for over nine years and teaching for 2 years. <span class="read-more-target"><br><br>
				My love for numerous genres is reflected by my many current & previous bands which include, The Northcote College Jazz band/Combo,
				These Guys, Lenny and the Laidbacks, Petra Bullock, LAKES, Tim Finn & for many other solo artists. <br>My lessons compact awesome rhythmic activities and enjoyable material into 30 minutes.<br>
				I also provide a free comprehensive progression video for each student every term. <br>Feel free to contact me any time.</span></p>
