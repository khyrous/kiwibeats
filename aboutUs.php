				What makes us different to other teachers is our age.
				Our goal to stimulate a passion for each student is achieved not only through enjoyable lessons but through our ability to relate to students.<br>
				We have recently been in the same position as our students so we sure know what was difficult, 
				<span class="read-more-target"><br>we know what areas need focusing on and we certainly know the stages of learning which need to be made enjoyable. 
					All of our teachers have been through years of lessons and are very experienced.<br> For further information on our team refer to the contact list. <br>
					Our team is continuously growing so if we’re not in your area be sure to keep an eye on this site.</span></p>
