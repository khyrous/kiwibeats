				30 minute private weekly lessons - $25 (first week free)<br>
				Group lessons (subject to availability) - $15<br><br>lessons are focused on being fun & enjoyable for the student.<br>
				This is an important aspect to us as we firmly believe that significant results are a product of the students’ interest in music & their given instrument.
				<span class="read-more-target"><br><br>lessons are aimed towards beginner & intermediate musicians or soon to be musicians, 
				who are keen to improve their musical vocabulary or for beginners wanting an introductory 
				to an instrument and music as a whole.
